# ipynb_to_py

Simple script takes a folder and recursively finds all ipynb files. For each ipynb file that it finds, it creates a Python script with the same name and extracts all the code blocks to that file.

WARNING: The current version will replace all existing Python files that have matching names. In the next version, I will add an option to preserve the old file.
